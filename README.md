# Temperature-and-Humidity-Data-logging-II
Logging temperature and humidity data to cloud (ex: AWS) using ESP8266 Nodemcu and DHT11 Sensor


### Components required:
  1. ESP8266 NODEMCU
  
  2. DHT11/DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  
  3. Breadboard(if required)
  
  4. Connecting wires or jumper wires

### Pre-requisites:
 1. Arduino IDE [get it here](https://arduino.en.softonic.com/)
 
 2. You need to manually add DHT library to Arduino IDE as it is not included by default. You can ignore it if you have already included it. Otherwise you can do it following the     steps below.<br>
      a).Open Arduino IDE <br>
      b).Go to Sketch >> Include Library >> Manage Libraries <br>
      c).Search for DHT sensor library and install it
